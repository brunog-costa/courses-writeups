The first and most critical type of XSS vulnerability is `Stored XSS` or `Persistent XSS`. If our injected XSS payload gets stored in the back-end database and retrieved upon visiting the page, this means that our XSS attack is persistent and may affect any user that visits the page.

**Tip:** Many modern web applications utilize cross-domain IFrames to handle user input, so that even if the web form is vulnerable to XSS, it would not be a vulnerability on the main web application. This is why we are showing the value of `window.origin` in the alert box, instead of a static value like `1`. In this case, the alert box would reveal the URL it is being executed on, and will confirm which form is the vulnerable one, in case an IFrame was being used.

# Testing Stored XSS

We can confirm this further by looking page source by clicking [`CTRL+U`] or right-clicking and selecting `View Page Source`, and we should see our payload in the page source after injecting a persistent script tag.
