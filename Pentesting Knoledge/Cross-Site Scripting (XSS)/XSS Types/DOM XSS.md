The third and final type of XSS is another `Non-Persistent` type called `DOM-based XSS`. While `reflected XSS` sends the input data to the back-end server through HTTP requests, DOM XSS is completely processed on the client-side through JavaScript. DOM XSS occurs when JavaScript is used to change the page source through the `Document Object Model (DOM)`.

We see that the input parameter in the URL is using a hashtag `#` for the item we added, which means that this is a client-side parameter that is completely processed on the browser. This indicates that the input is being processed at the client-side through JavaScript and never reaches the back-end; hence it is a `DOM-based XSS`.

# Source & Sink

To further understand the nature of the DOM-based XSS vulnerability, we must understand the concept of the `Source` and `Sink` of the object displayed on the page. The `Source` is the JavaScript object that takes the user input, and it can be any input parameter like a URL parameter or an input field, as we saw above.

On the other hand, the `Sink` is the function that writes the user input to a DOM Object on the page. If the `Sink` function does not properly sanitize the user input, it would be vulnerable to an XSS attack. Some of the commonly used JavaScript functions to write to DOM objects are:

- `document.write()`
- `DOM.innerHTML`
- `DOM.outerHTML`

Furthermore, some of the `jQuery` library functions that write to DOM objects are:

- `add()`
- `after()`
- `append()`

We can look at the source code of the `To-Do` web application, and check `script.js`, and we will see that the `Source` is being taken from the `task=` parameter:

Code: javascript

```javascript
var pos = document.URL.indexOf("task=");
var task = document.URL.substring(pos + 5, document.URL.length);
```
